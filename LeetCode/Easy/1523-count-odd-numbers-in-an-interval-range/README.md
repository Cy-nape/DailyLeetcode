```cpp
(low % 2 != 0 || high % 2 != 0 ? 1 : 0)
```

### This is a **ternary conditional expression**, which works like:

```cpp
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;
```

---

### Let's understand each part:

1. **`low % 2 != 0`**

   * This checks if `low` is an **odd number**.
   * For example, if `low = 3`, `3 % 2 = 1`, so `true`.

2. **`high % 2 != 0`**

   * This checks if `high` is an **odd number**.
   * If `high = 7`, then `7 % 2 = 1`, also `true`.

3. **`low % 2 != 0 || high % 2 != 0`**

   * The **logical OR** (`||`) means:

     * If either `low` or `high` is odd → this condition is `true`.
     * Else → `false`.

### Why do we need this?

When we do:

```cpp
(high - low) / 2
```

That gives us the number of **odd numbers between** `low` and `high`.

However, if **either** `low` or `high` is odd, we might be **missing one** odd number **at the boundary**.

So we add:

```cpp
+ (condition ? 1 : 0)
```

This ensures that if **either boundary is odd**, we count that one extra odd number too.

### Example:

For `low = 3`, `high = 7`

* `(high - low)/2 = 2` (counts 5 only)
* Since both 3 and 7 are odd → we add **1** more to include either 3 or 7

So:

```cpp
2 + 1 = 3  // Correct total odd numbers: 3, 5, 7
```
